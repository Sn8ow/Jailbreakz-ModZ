The script works on all versions of Roblox so don't worry it won't work.

# How use ?
To use the script you need an injector such as Synapse-X or Krnl (In Releases).
Krnl injector with Synapse-x works well to get bugs such as: Teleport not working or Spawn Guns. 
Therefore, we recommend that you use Krnl.
